# Attendance with Face Recognition

## About the Project

This project utilizes face recognition technology to automate the process of attendance management. By leveraging computer vision and machine learning techniques, the system can identify and mark attendance of individuals in real-time, eliminating the need for manual tracking and reducing errors.

Key Features:
- **Real-Time Face Recognition**: Identifies individuals from live video feeds or uploaded images.
- **Automated Attendance Logging**: Marks attendance in a database, ensuring accuracy and easy access.
- **Efficient and Scalable**: Designed to handle a large number of faces with high accuracy.

# Attendance with Face Recognition

## Overview
This project automates attendance management using advanced face recognition techniques. By replacing manual attendance systems, it ensures efficiency, accuracy, and ease of access, making it suitable for educational institutions, workplaces, and events.

## Features
- **Real-Time Face Recognition**: Captures and recognizes faces through live video streams.
- **Database Integration**: Stores attendance records securely for easy retrieval and analysis.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Intuitive design for seamless operation.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Core programming language.
- **OpenCV**: For image processing and face detection.
- **Dlib**: For face recognition and alignment.
- **SQLite**: For storing attendance data.
